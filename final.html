			<p>Inside some of America’s most restricted places, where rights are taken away and freedoms are a distant memory, another structure of imprisonment is put in place: the censorship of literature. </p>
			<p>The right for prisoners to have access to a library is guaranteed by the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/mandeladay/mandela_rules.shtml" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela Rules</a>, also known as the United Nations’ Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. The legal document contains 122 rules on the well-being of incarcerated people, with the right to a library falling at number 64. </p>
			<p><a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED612492.pdf" target="_blank">The Education Resources Information Center</a> released a policy brief on the benefits of prison libraries. Providing access to educational resources, encouraging understanding of different ethnic backgrounds, and rehabilitation through autonomy and intellectual freedom are all positives that come from having these literary centers. However, with prison libraries becoming more <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2801711" target="_blank">underfunded</a> and an increased amount of books being banned, studies from PEN America are allowing more people to explore the hidden world of banned books behind bars.</p>

			<h3>Banned books in Texas prisons</h3>
			<p>According to a <a href="https://pen.org/press-release/new-pen-america-report-u-s-prisons-ban-staggering-numbers-of-books/" target="_blank">2023 PEN America report</a>, Texas is the state with the second most books banned in prisons and correctional facilities, boasting over 10,000 censored titles. They are only topped by the state of Florida, which has just under 30,000 books barred from their carceral buildings. These numbers are based on self-reported statistics from each of the state’s criminal justice departments. Texas is also the state that has the largest reported incarcerated population in the nation with over 130,000 people currently living in prisons and jails, according to a <a href="https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/prison-population-by-state/#:~:text=Texas%20has%20the%20highest%20prison,and%20Maine%20with%201%2C577%20prisoners." target="_blank">WiseVoter study</a>.</p>

			<p> The same PEN America report stated that the most common reason for content-based censorship is under the category of “sexually explicit”. This ranges from story content, images, and medical diagrams. However, the absence of proper documentation for tracking how these lists were formed leaves the likely thought that the true extent of carceral censorship, especially in southern states, is probably much higher than what is present in the report.</p>
			<p>Based on data released from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t1mnAPg7uQsViWlOoglBYZm53_-VapQG/edit#gid=1828730165" target="_blank">Texas State Criminal Justice Department</a>, sexually explicit images account for almost half of books banned from prisons in a given year. These are decided objectively by the department and range from child nudity to images of weapons.</p>

			<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/there-are-nearly-10000-books-banned-from-texas-prisons-heres-why/" target="_blank">NBC's KXAN</a> in Austin, Texas had a conversation with a journalist within the <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-list-find-your-state" target="_blank">Marshall Project</a> about the established list of books banned in prisons across the United States. Keri Blakinger said the biggest shock was seeing how different the numbers were across state lines. Even other southern states, like Louisiana and Alabama, had vastly different amounts of banned books.</p>
			<p><a href="https://insidebooksproject.org/" target="_blank">The Inside Books Project</a> is a volunteer-based organization that started in 1998 to send books to incarcerated citizens in Texas. At the time there were no groups like them in the state and they recognized the immense benefits that come with having access to relevant literature.</p>
			<p>“More than 70% of the people imprisoned in Texas are functionally illiterate and books help people improve their literacy skills, learn legal skills, self-educate themselves, help with mental stresses in prison, and help people to find employment upon release with trade books that we provide.” said a representative from the Inside Books Project.</p>
			<p>They currently send about 1,000 books to people in prisons per month.</p>

			<h3>Banned books in New York State Prisons</h3>
			<p>According to a 2019 report from the <a href="https://nicic.gov/resources/nic-library/state-statistics/2019/new-york-2019" target="_blank">National Institute of Corrections</a>, there are 54 state prisons and 62 jails in New York with over 60,000 people in these state funded institutions. The New York State Criminal Justice Department is less strict about what books are banned compared to those in southern states, like Texas. However prison libraries are still understocked, leading to the formation of books to prisoners programs. New York has five of these established programs, setting them as one of the leading states for these services.</p>
			<p><a href="https://appellate-litigation.org/Books-Beyond-Bars" target="_blank">Books Beyond Bars</a> is one of these projects based under the Center for Appellate Litigation in New York City. Originally founded as a program for clients of the law firm during the long appeals process, it has now expanded to provide reading materials to any incarcerated person in the five boroughs, including the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/18/nyregion/rikers-island-authors.html#:~:text=With%20about%206%2C200%20detainees%2C%20it,to%20take%20over%20the%20complex." target="_blank">Rikers Island</a> jail complex, one of the most populated correctional facilities in the United States.</p>
			<p>Alexandra Schoenborn is the program coordinator at Books Beyond Bars and a paralegal at CAL. She said the biggest thing that sets them apart from other book to prisoner programs is that they’re run through a legal clinic, while many others, like the Inside Books Project are volunteer based. As a result, BBB often has shorter turnaround times and connections to obtain books other organizations might not have. </p>
			<p>Shoenborn said the organization brings humanity to a group widely forgotten about.</p>
			<p>“It’s very easy to write off a population that’s basically invisible.” said Schoenborn, “I think that if most people were to meet someone who’s incarcerated then they would come away from that experience differently.”</p>

			</div>
			<p>Books Beyond bars received about 450 requests per month so far this year, with the top categories being nonfiction, religious texts, and role-playing books. Banning based on the content of books aside, hardback books and those with spiral binding are not allowed on the basis of security concerns, and books containing maps of the state must be ripped out before being distributed.</p>
			<p>When asked what the most surprising book they’ve sent that has been rejected was, Schoenborn told the story of a slightly worn book being sent back because it “looked like it was soaked in narcotics”.</p>
			<p>“The way drugs tend to be brought into facilities is mostly through connections within the organization, mostly through corrections officers themselves. So it is pretty crazy when you get accused of that.” said Schoenborn.</p>
			<p>On the basis of content, she also said a copy of the historical novel “Native Son” by Richard Wright was recently rejected from a prison due to its “violent content”, despite permitting fictional books with similar violent acts.</p>
			<p>“It was one of those examples of ‘I don’t think if that book had been by a white author that it would have been rejected.’” said Schoenborn. “In the bannings of authors of color, there is a certain prejudice towards the very people that are being most harmed by the system.”</p>
			<p>She said her definition of success is the thought of the smile on a person’s face when they’re called into the mailroom to receive their book.</p>

			<h3> Prison Libraries Act </h3>
			<p>The recent <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2825" target="_blank">Prison Libraries Act</a> was passed by Congress on April 25, 2023, directing the Department of Justice to ensure that funds are specifically placed aside to establish and expand library services to incarcerated individuals. This was promoted by PEN America along with hosting the first ever <a href="https://pen.org/campaign/prison-banned-books-week-2023/"target="_blank">Prison Banned Books Week</a> in October of 2023. The mission is to bring awareness to the mission of providing resources to those beyond the bars. </p>
